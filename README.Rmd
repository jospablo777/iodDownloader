# iodDownloader <a><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" /></a>


## Overview

To facilitate access to the Iowa Open Data portal, iodDownloader provides utilities for downloading data in batches. This can be helpful for the most extensive data sets that cannot be downloaded at once.


## Installation

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jospablo777/iodDownloader")
```


## Usage

The package comprises two functions, `download_iowa_data` and `read_iowa_data`. First, pick the data set you want to download; let's say we want to download the Iowa Fire Department Census data set: https://data.iowa.gov/Emergency-Management/Iowa-Fire-Department-Census/hv43-6ksq/about_data

From the URL of your data set, you must pick its ID; in this case, it is `hv43-6ksq`. Then, you indicate where you want to store the data, the number of rows you want, and the size of the batches.


```{r example_download, eval = FALSE}
library(iodDownloader)

download_iowa_data(data_id   = 'hv43-6ksq',
                   folder    = 'data',  # Folder in which we want to store the data. In this case we have chosen a folder called 'data/'
                   data_name = 'fire_department_census', # Name we want for the local copy of the data set
                   total_of_rows = 2000, # In this example we will pull only the first 2k rows of the data set
                   batch_size    = 500)  # We chose the size of the batches we want to pull
                     
```

After we download our data set, we can load it into memory with `read_iowa_data.`


```{r example_read, eval = FALSE}
# Please use the same foder and data names you used in your download
read_iowa_data(folder_path = 'data',
               data_name   = 'fire_department_census')
                     
```
